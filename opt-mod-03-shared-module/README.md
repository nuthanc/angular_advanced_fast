### 7. Component Declarations

* In RecipesModule, we don't have to export Recipe Components because we are not using it in the AppComponent or its children and used only internally

### 8. The ShoppingList Feature Module

* Create Module for ShoppingList similar to Recipes
* Move routing related stuff also to ShoppingListModule and no need to create another file for routing since it includes only 1 Route
